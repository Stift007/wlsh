# wlsh
The WorstLinuxSHell you can possibly have is here!

## Why should I use it?
The answer is pretty Simple: ***Don't***

## Okay but then why did you create it?  
Because I was bored.
  
## Does it atleast have functionality?
Yes, it does: It has the most basic Commands (Like `cd dirname` `ls` `mkdir dirname`) and  
even a text editor

## Okay, then what are the Commands?  
- `cd dirname` : Navigate to a Directory  
- `mkdir dirname` : Make a new Directory
- `ls` : List all files in the Current Directory  
- `exit` : Quit WLSH
- `clear` : Clear the Screen
- `requests` : A Simple Integration of the requests-module:
  - `get url [Optional] -h {"headers":"Headers go here"}` : Perform a GET Request to a URL
- `sys command` : Execute an actual terminal Command using os.system()
- `cat filename` : Reads data from the file and gives their content as output.
- `wled` : Use the WorstLinuxEDitor, a Text Editor specifically built for this Shell
